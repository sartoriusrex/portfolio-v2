<h1>About</h1>
<ul>
<li>About Me!</li>
<li>I'm a father and a husband and a life-long student of all things. I'm a self-taught programmer, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Blue Belt, atheist, amateur Table Tennis competitor, half-marathon runner, lake-swimmer, bear-chasing backpacking guide, and ravenous reader of many genres.</li>
<li></li>
<li>[RESUME]</li>
<li></li>
<li>Oh, you're still here? Okay, I'll tell you more.</li>
<li>I was born (and raised) in Wichita, Kansas to Vietnamese refugees. English was my second language, but not my last. I studied Economics and Spanish at Wichita State University and studied abroad for 1 year in Murcia, Spain, where I met my bombastic Swiss wife. I graduated, moved to Switzerland, learned German and French, got married, and started our family in Zurich. We got bored, so we moved to Kauai, Hawaii. Now, you can find us romping in the snow  and lakes back in Switzerland.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Projects</h1>
<ul>
<li>Here's a short list of projects I have or am currently working on. Feel free to step through the code, make some  pull requests, or visit the live sites. Be patient, some of them are asleep on a Heroku Dyno.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Polyglotist</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A web application for intermediate language learners to improve reading fluency and vocabulary. Users can read foreign language newspapers, as well as look up words and phrases and save them. Looking up and saving can be done in a total of 3 clicks, a drastic speed increase from leaving the app or window to look up and document a word. This helps learners improve fluency with increasing focus on the text at hand instead of abruptly switching contexts.</li>

<li>Jiu Jitsu Distilled</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A web application for users to document and share Brazilian Jiu Jitsu techniques and their relationships to one another. Users can fully document techniques and link to videos, connect techniques in sequences, like them, and share them in-app with other users or by e-mail. There are hundreds of grappling techniques and many variations between them. Flowing from one to another is the essence of Jiu Jitsu, but understanding how and when they can move from one to another is a large undertaking. This application helps document flows.</li>
