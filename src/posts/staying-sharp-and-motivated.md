# How I Stay Sharp and Motivated to Keep Learning

It's no secret that in the world of programming, and especially in the Web Development domain, it is both challenging to get started and to stay current with technology. Leetcode grinding, Personal Projects, Side Projects, Experience, Portfolios, Internships. It's all par for the course. That doesn't include whatever personal tribulations each of us encounters -- financial, familial, emotional.

Even after that first job, it can still be overwhelming to keep up with the trends in technology, new (old) best practices, old and legacy technology, and relevant blog posts and package updates. (This post doesn't count. I'm writing more for myself than for you. Sorry, dear reader).

Sure, you do just fine if you're not learning new technologies, depending on your niche. But it eventually catches up, unless you change careers completely. Most of us need to learn to stay competative and relevant. Anyway, most of us want to, because part of the draw of programming comes from the learning, the tinkering, the problem-solving and creative processes.

## Embracing the grind

Even more disheartening, there's too much for any one person to know. We have to choose wisely what we want to invest our time and energy learning, because it's a rare individual that can effectively learn and apply 15 programming languages, methodologies and best practices, library interfaces and apis, *and* soft skills to be a 10x developer.

Let's face it, more than half of us don't stray far from average. That's statistics. And that's okay. So how do we best utilize our average resources to optimize our programming performance?

By being strategic and calculated about what we learn, when we learn it, and how we retain that knowledge.

## Learning how to learn -- my personal methods

I can't speak for everybody, but I learn best by following these steps:

1. Figuring out what I want to do, whether it be learning a new technology, addressing a specific, personal or professional need, or just fixing a bug.
2. Learning what others have done to solve this specific problem, if it's been solved before. When there are multiple solutions, find one that suits my needs the best.
3. Applying whatever solution I find through IMPLEMENTING IT in my own code
4. Reading documentation, blogs, and other code to better implement the solution
5. Taking notes, breaks, and returning to the code later
6. Repeat steps 3 to 5

For me, it's really too academic to just read and take notes. I have to practice, implement, act. Knowledge sinks in best when applied. Taking notes is also useful, but, again, without practice, it's just in-and-out, theoretical knowledge -- impractical.

This method applies both to my professional and personal projects. It's how I keep up with old and new tech and best practices. When best practices, libraries, or APIs change, I refactor. That's also an amazing time to learn, especially from myself. It's how I benchmark my own progress as well, whether or not I can read my own code later, judging its readability, organization, efficiency, and efficacy.

## Switching context

But it's not just projects I dip my brain toes in. I'm constantly reading books and articles. I read when I'm awake and my brain is active, and when I tire, I take a break or do something completely different, such as go on a walk, do some exercises, go to Jiu Jitsu practice.

When I'm bored of working on a project, I leetcode. And when that's boring, I work on a project, or read.

My brain needs constant stimulation, but not always the same kind. That's why it's good for me to switch context. I'm almost always learning, and never vegging out, but what I'm learning and how is constantly varying. I can only work my attention span so long to be effective. But switching context is like a breath of fresh air.

## Learning how to learn

There are a lot of resources on this topic, but suffice it to say that this meta-skill is the most important skill to have. Period. This is the (post) Information age, where industries and fields are born and die within a generation and workers change careers multiple times, often within the same decade.

You have to be flexible, emotionally, mentally, physically. It means moving. It means learning. It means being resilient. It's the new normal, and if you can't, you have to at least be taking care of yourself.

## Taking care of myself

I also notice an enormous different when I eat, sleep, and exercise correctly. It's too easy for me to get lost in code, reading, and knowledge. 

I can easily stay up late at night coding. But the different in the morning is especially stark. My toddler wakes up between 5 and 6:30 no matter what. Sometimes she she has nightmares. I can't plan for that. I can control when I go to bed, and I know I need at least 8 hours to function above 90% during the day. Coffee doesn't cut it.

I also doesn't sleep well when I eat and drink poorly. Alcohol, especially, destroys the quality of my sleep, and junk food fogs my brain and attention. Lots of fatty, sugary food will do that. Eating lots of veggies, fruit and protein, with a healthy -- but not overly abundant -- dose of complex carbs keeps my mood steady throughout the day and my sleep extra nice.

And the best sleep happens when I eat and drink well and go to bed at 22:00 after having done at least 30 minutes of exercise in the day. Even if it means a 30 minute walk. Without that, my brain might be tired, but my body isn't, and I have trouble falling and staying asleep.

### Summary

A career in programming is a long-distance sprint. No, that's not an oxymoron. There are times when the pressure to meet a deadline is overwhelming, so we're sprinting to implement a solution. When that's not the case, we're simply learning something new, mixing our creative juices with our critical thinking and problem-solving.

Mental and emotional stamina, resilience, flexibility, and raw power are necessary to thrive in such an environment. So we have to take care of ourselves and utilize our resources to the best of our personal abilities.

Sorry if that was long-winded.
