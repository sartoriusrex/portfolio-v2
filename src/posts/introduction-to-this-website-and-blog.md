# Introduction to this Website and Blog

Greetings brave surfer[*](#note1) of the world wide web! And welcome back to the weird web!

This website is an expression of myself, my tastes, my thoughts. It's a throwback to the indie web, when people were using AOL Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Xanga, MySpace, LiveJournal, and Google Blogs to connect with others. This is my digital garden, and I hope it evokes the same sense of nostalgia for you as it does for me for a time long past.

## An innocent time...

This website is also my own custom blog. It is far from perfect, but it's mine. In here, I write about technology, culture, society, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Fatherhood, being a husband (husband...hood?), and other things, too. I hope my writing inspires and provokes you, dear reader.

## This place isn't 100% Accessible

I try to make sure everybody can digest my content, but, you know what? I won't be able to make everyone happy. And that's okay. That's life. I'm sorry if I offend any of you (truly, I am). This place is a work in progress, and I will continue to make it as accessible to as many people as I can.

That said, you can always send me feedback via email.

Enjoy the tour, and and I hope you'll be inspiried to make the web a little bit better. And a little bit weirder.
