# Introduction to this Website and Blog

Greetings web [surfer*](#note1) and welcome back to the weird web!

This website is a work of *self expression*. Here I lay to bare my thoughts, ideas, my learning and doubt.

It's also a homage to the primordial [indie web](https://indieweb.org/) that makes the internet such a fascinating place. 

This website is also my own custom blog. It is far from perfect, but it's mine. I write about Technology, Society & Culture, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Fatherhood, being a husband (Husband...hood?), and lots of other things.

## My Promise to You

This place is a work in progress. Right now, it's not 100% accessible, but I will continue to make it as accessible to as many people as I can.

That said, you can always send me feedback via email.

Enjoy the tour, and and I hope you'll be inspired to make the web a little bit better. And a little bit weirder.
