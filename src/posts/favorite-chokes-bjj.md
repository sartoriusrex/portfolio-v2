# Chokes and Strangulations - My Favorite Ways to Safely Submit Someone

This may sound weird (or it won't, if you're familiar with Jiu Jitsu), but I have a very specific list of favorite chokes for Jiu Jitsu.

In order, they have GOT to be:

1. The Ezekiel Choke
2. The Loop Choke
3. The Rear Naked Choke
4. The Bow-and-Arrow Choke
5. The Anaconda
6. The D'arce
7. The North-South Choke
8. The Peruvian Necktie
9. The Arm-in Guillotine
10. THE MOTHER'S MILK
BONUS. The Triangle Choke. (This should be #1, but it's such a staple. C'mon!)

I'll go into the details for each one below, but suffice it to say, this is a non-exhaustive list of awesome chokes everybody doing BJJ should know.
