 <h1 id="introduction-to-this-website-and-blog">Introduction to this Website and Blog</h1>
<p>Greetings brave surfer<a href="#note1">*</a> of the world wide web! And welcome back to the weird web!</p>
<p>This website is a work of <em>self expression</em>. Here I lay to bare my thoughts, ideas, my learning and doubt.</p>
<p>It's also a throwback to the early days of the internet, a homage to the primordial <a href="https://indieweb.org/">indie web</a> that made the internet such a fascinating place to begin with. </p>
<p>People were using AOL Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Xanga, MySpace, LiveJournal, and Google Blogs to connect with others. This is my digital garden, and I hope it evokes the same sense of nostalgia for you as it does for me for a time long past.</p>
<h2 id="an-innocent-time">An innocent time...</h2>
<p>This website is also my own custom blog. It is far from perfect, but it's mine. In here, I write about technology, culture, society, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Fatherhood, being a husband (husband...hood?), and other things, too. I hope my writing inspires and provokes you, dear reader.</p>
<h2 id="this-place-isnt-100-accessible">This place isn't 100% Accessible</h2>
<p>I try to make sure everybody can digest my content, but, you know what? I won't be able to make everyone happy. And that's okay. That's life. I'm sorry if I offend any of you (truly, I am). </p>
<p>This place is a work in progress, and I will continue to make it as accessible to as many people as I can.</p>
<p>That said, you can always send me feedback via email.</p>
<p>Enjoy the tour, and and I hope you'll be inspired to make the web a little bit better. And a little bit weirder.</p>
<p><a name="note1"></a> When the internet was first becoming popular, it was called the "World Wide Web", and those browsing the internet then were "surfing the web." Good times.</p>
