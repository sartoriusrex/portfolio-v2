<p>This may sound weird (or it won't, if you're familiar with Jiu Jitsu), but I have a very specific list of favorite chokes for Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>In order, they have GOT to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Ezekiel Choke</li>
<li>The Loop Choke</li>
<li>The Rear Naked Choke</li>
<li>The Bow-and-Arrow Choke</li>
<li>The Anaconda</li>
<li>The D'arce</li>
<li>The North-South Choke</li>
<li>The Peruvian Necktie</li>
<li>The Arm-in Guillotine</li>
<li>THE MOTHER'S MILK
BONUS. The Triangle Choke. (This should be #1, but it's such a staple. C'mon!)</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll go into the details for each one below, but suffice it to say, this is a non-exhaustive list of awesome chokes everybody doing BJJ should know.</p>
